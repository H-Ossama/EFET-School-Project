# EFET School Project - Visitor Role and Admin Approval System

## Overview of Changes

This update implements a comprehensive visitor role and admin approval system for the EFET School Project. When users sign up through "S'inscrire", they now get a "visiteur" role with pending status and limited access until approved by administrators.

## ‚ú® New Features

- **Limited Access**: Visitors can only access:
  - Home page (`/`)
  - Profile page (`/profile`)
  - Update profile functionality
- **Access Restriction**: Visitors cannot access dashboard, grades, payments, messaging, etc.

### 2. Admin Notification System
- **Automatic Notifications**: When a user signs up, an admin notification is automatically created
- **Notification Dashboard**: Admins have a dedicated notifications page at `/admin/notifications`
- **Real-time Badge**: Navigation shows notification count for admins

### 3. Admin User Management
- **User Approval**: Admins can approve users and assign roles (student/teacher)

- **Email System**: Built-in email interface to communicate with users
- **Email Templates**: Pre-built templates for common scenarios:
  - Account approval
  - Account rejection  
  - Information requests

### 4. Enhanced UI/UX
- **Pending Approval Page**: Beautiful page shown to visitors explaining the 72-hour approval process
